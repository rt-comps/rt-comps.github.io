# Modules Directory #

This directory is intended to hold all modules.

Each module is availale with the suggested `.mjs` extension.
While this is file extension is not yet completely standard, modules are published via GitHub Pages so the .mjs extension is correctly served as type *text/javascript*.

Currently the directory contains the following files
### rt.mjs ###
Functions that are used throughout most components.  
More information [here](rt.md)
### rt_baseclass.mjs ###
A class that extends **HTMLElement** with some useful additional methods.  
More information [here](rt_baseclass.md)
### rt_form.mjs ###
Optional functions that can be used by components.  
More information [here](rt_form.md)
